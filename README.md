<h1 align="center"><em>Scaling phageâ€“bacteria dynamics from pairwise interactions to complex communities</em>: Code repository</h1>

*By Raunak Dey, 2024*


This is the repository for the paper -- if you want to take a more detailed look you may find our project [VIMIMO](https://github.com/RaunakDey/VIMIMO-Virus-Microbe-modeller/) useful. In this repository all the ODE models, the Bayesian scripts and figure generating scripts can be found. The Bayesian analysis is performed used DRAM-MCMC algorithm using the open-sourced mcmcstat package. 

## Requirements and installation

You will need MATLAB 2022b and higher to run this code. You need to install the mcmcstat package and add the directory to the matlab path which can be done with.
```
git clone git@github.com:mjlaine/mcmcstat.git
```
Check their documentation [here](https://mjlaine.github.io/mcmcstat/).
```matlab
addpath(genpath(./mcmcstat))
```
The data files and the mcmc chains come with the directory for the onesteps. For the community analysis you need to download the datafiles and put it in the proper directory. Here is the dropbox link to the mcmc runs. (Will be updated to a Zenodo repository.)
```

```
The results folder should be placed inside 
```
./community/
```


## Notes for the code reviewer:
We invite all reviewers to explore our models. However here is a suggested outline if you want to follow along with the paper.
- The onesteps are modeled using SEIV model, the ODE for that can be found in SI-1.1 in the paper and the code can be found with the [ODE models](./one-step-experiments/simulator/one_step_eqn_before_dilution.m) and [simulation function](./one-step-experiments/simulator/one_step_eqn_before_dilution.m) one_step_simulate_particular_points.m takes care of the the dilution.
- For the Bayesian analysis of each of the interactions we can look at the script_inverse_interactionsi.m files where $i=1,2,\dots,8$ for the 8 onestep growth curves. The one-step data is saved in [data_2024](./one-step-experiments/data_2024/) and the mcmc run results are stored in [result_replicates](./one-step-experiments/result_replicates/).
- For the community experiments, the data is stored [here](./community/data/) and the mcmcruns are being downloaded.
- We invite the reviewers to check the SEIV and SEIVD models in SI-1.3 and SI-1.4 respectively in the paper. The code for the same can be found here for [SEIV](./community/src/models/legacy/SEIV_diff_NE.m) and [SEIVD](./community/src/models/SEIVD_diff_NE_diff_debris_abs.m) 
- For just a forward run of the SEIVD model that fits the data with the best-fit parameters (non-Bayesian), you can run this [script](./community/median_SEIVD_model.m)
- The figures found in the paper can be generated using the scripts found in the directory [here](./figures_scripts/).
- Notes on runtime: The MCMC chains (not parallelized) can take a long time to converge, each of the onesteps take ~5 hours for 50000 steps on a M1-Macbook Pro, whereas 10 hours for 50000 steps for the 37 parameter community MCMC. 
- Unix vs Windows: Please note that, the file paths have been written in Unix format, so some of them might need to be tailored for Windows. '/' needs to be changed to '\' for Windows and the ':' in filenames might not be allowed in Windows.

Thank you.
